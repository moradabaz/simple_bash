==2046== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==2046== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==2046== or are doing some strange experiment):

==2046== 
==2046== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==2046==   /path/to/gdb ./simplesh
==2046== and then give GDB the following command
==2046==   target remote | /usr/local/Cellar/valgrind/3.15.0/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=2046
==2046== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
